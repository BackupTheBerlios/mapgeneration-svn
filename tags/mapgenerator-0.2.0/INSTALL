This program is not intended for the end users and therefore installation 
_may be_ a bit tricky.


Requirements
############

General:
	- commoncpp2: Most versions work. :-)
	- wxWindows/wxWidgets: xrc-support is required, this is always 
	  compiled in version 2.5 and optionally available in 2.4

The optional ODBC backend requires unixODBC on Linux systems.


Compilation
###########

The configure script and the config.h.in template file are not included in the 
subversion repository. If you have a repository version you have to create 
these files by executing 

# autoconf
# autoheader

in the program directory. The releases already include these files.
After that you can give configure a try, just run

# ./configure

if it complains about missing libraries, have a look at the configure options 
with

# ./configure --help

Especially --with-wx-config-path and --with-ccgnu2-config-path are interesting.
If you need odbc support under cygwin you will always need to supply the 
complete name, including the path, to odbc32.dll with --with-odbc32-dll.

After configure finished, run

# ./make all

to compile the main program, the gui and all tests. If one of the tests fails,
just ignore it. They are not really important. 


Installation
############

...is not yet supported. In the future this will probably work with make 
install...


Running
#######

The programs are configured using xml configuration files: mapgenerator.conf
for the server and mgg.conf for the gui. In most cases the default setup
will work for you. If you have downloaded a svn snapshot of the program the
configuration files are included as .conf.release files. Just copy them to
.conf files to get the default configuration.
Since version 0.2.0 the database is no longer required. In the default setup
a simple file backend is used to store the data in the directory filedb below
your current working directory. Changing the db type from 'file' to 'odbc' in
the configuration files yields the old program behaviour. Other parameters 
change the used directory or database connection.
We recommend to use a database for important or big maps, because the odbc 
backend is tested a much longer time and probably more secure.

In short: Use

# bin/main	to run the main program

and

# bin/gui/mgg	to run the gui

To stop the server enter 'x'. If debugging is enabled you may also leave the
server with 'y' to delete the database.


Further information about using the program and a set of example traces is 
available online at the MapGeneration Project homepage at
