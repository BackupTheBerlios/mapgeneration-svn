This program is not intended for the end users and therefore installation 
_may be_ a bit tricky.


Requirements
############

General:
	- commoncpp2: Most versions work. :-)
	- wxWindows/wxWidgets: xrc-support is required, this is always 
	  compiled in version 2.5 and optionally available in 2.4

The optional ODBC backend requires unixODBC on Linux systems.


Compilation
###########

The configure script and the config.h.in template file are not included in the 
subversion repository. If you have a repository version you have to create 
these files by executing 

# autoconf
# autoheader

in the program directory. The releases already include these files.

After that you can give configure a try, just run

# ./configure

if it complains about missing libraries, have a look at the configure options 
with

# ./configure --help

Especially --with-wx-config-path and --with-ccgnu2-config-path interesting. 
On cygwin you will always need to supply the complete name, including the path, to odbc32.dll with --with-odbc32-dll.

After configure finished, run

# ./make
# ./make gui

to compile the main program and the gui. make all will try to compile the 
exporter and tests, but these do not work at the moment...


Installation
############

...is not yet supported. In the future this will probably work with make 
install...


Running
#######

Since version 0.2.0 the database is no longer required. In the default setup
a simple file backend is used to store the data in the directory filedb below
you current working directory. The db backend and it's parameters are configured
via the mapgeneration.conf and mgg.conf files. Changing the db type from 
'file' to 'odbc' yields the old program behaviour. Other parameters change the 
used directory or database connection.
We recommend to use a database for important or big maps, because the odbc 
backend is tested a much longer time and probably more secure.

In short: Use

# bin/main	to run the main program

and

# bin/gui/mgg	to run the gui

Further information about using the program and a set of example traces is 
available online at the MapGeneration Project homepage at 
mapgeneration.berlios.de.
