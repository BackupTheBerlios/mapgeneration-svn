This program is not intended for the end users and therefore installation 
_may be_ a bit tricky.


Requirements
############

General:
	- commoncpp2: Most versions work. :-)
	- wxWindows/wxWidgets: xrc-support is required, this is always 
	  compiled in version 2.5 and optionally available in 2.4

Linux:
	- unixODBC


Cygwin:
	- ODBC: I'm not sure in the moment, if you have to install 
	  something. :-/


Compilation
###########

The configure script and the config.h.in template file are not included in the subversion repository. If you have a repository version you have to create these files by executing 

# autoconf
# autoheader

in the program directory. The releases already include these files.

After that you can give configure a try, just run

# ./configure

if it complains about missing libraries, have a look at the configure options with

# ./configure --help

Especially --with-wx-config-path, --with-ccgnu2-config-path and --with-odbc-dir
are interesting. On cygwin you will always need to supply the complete name,
including the path, to odbc32.dll with --with-odbc32-dll.

After configure finished, run

# ./make
# ./make gui

to compile the main program and the gui. make all will try to compile the exporter and tests, but these do not work at the moment...


Installation
############

...is not yet supported. In the future this will probably work with make install...


Running
#######

As all data is stored into a database we need to create a database and register it with unixODBC. The following entry in the file ~/.odbc.ini works for me. You have to use exactly these names for the odbc entry (MapGeneration), database (mapgeneration), user (mapgeneration) and password (mg) at the moment. (At least if you do not want to edit the source code... :-) Instead of manually editing the config file you can also use a odbc gui, of course.
 
 [MapGeneration]
 Description = MySQL MapGeneration Database
 Driver = /usr/lib/libmyodbc3.so
 SERVER = localhost
 USER = mapgeneration
 PASSWORD = mg
 DATABASE = mapgeneration
 SOCKET = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
 PORT = 3306

After the database is started type

# bin/main	to run the main program

# cd bin/gui
# ./mgg		to run the gui

Further information about using the program and a set of example traces is available online at the MapGeneration Project homepage at mapgeneration.berlios.de.
