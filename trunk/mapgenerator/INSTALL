This program is not intended for the end users and therefore installation 
_may be_ a bit tricky.



Requirements
############

_General_

- commoncpp2: Most versions work. :-)
- wxWindows/wxWidgets: xrc-support is needed, this alway compiled in version 2.5
	 and optionally available in 2.4


_Linux_

- unixODBC


_Cygwin_

- ODBC: I'm not sure in the moment, if you have to install something. :-/



Compilation
###########

At first you have to generate the configure script by starting autoconf in
the program directory. After that you can give configure a try, just run

# ./configure

if it complains about missing libraries, have a look at the configure options

# ./configure --help

Especially --with-wx-config-path, --with-ccgnu2-config-path and --with-odbc-dir
are interesting. On cygwin you will always need to supply the complete name,
including the path, to odbc32.dll with --with-odbc32-dll.

After configure finished, run

# ./make all

to compile everything.



Installation
############

...is not yet supported.



Running
#######

To run the programs you need to configure a database for use with odbc.
Something like this in your .odbc.ini will do the trick:

[MapGeneration]
Description = MapGeneration Database
Trace = Off
TraceFile = stderr
Driver = ???
SERVER = ???
USER = mapgeneration
PASSWORD = mg
PORT = ???
DATABASE = mapgeneration
SOCKET = ???

The database name and password are not configurabe at the moment. The 
database layout is fixed automatically if the needed tables are not 
found.At the moment only MySQL-support is tested.

After the database is started type

# bin/main	to run the main program

# cd bin/gui
# ./mgg		to run the gui
